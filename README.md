AdRoll Code Test


The "public" contains all of the runtime app source code. The "app" folder contains all of the .coffee, .hbs, and .styl source files for your review. "index.html" will reveal the working test. I used Brunch to construct the app, with backbone.js and chaplin.coffee as application frameworks. I hope that you will find this methodology acceptable despite. In a production environment I would have cleaned up many on the unused features (views, models, ect.), forgive the mess.
